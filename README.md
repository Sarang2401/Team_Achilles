## 🔧 Systems Overview

### 1. Drowsiness Detection System
- Uses sensors like IR eye blink or camera-based modules to detect signs of fatigue.
- Triggers alerts (buzzer or LED) when drowsiness is detected.
- Includes PCB layout for sensor-microcontroller integration.

### 2. Seat Belt Monitoring System
- Monitors seatbelt usage with switches or pressure sensors.
- Can trigger alerts or lock ignition if belt is not fastened.
- Custom PCB designed for compact vehicle deployment.
